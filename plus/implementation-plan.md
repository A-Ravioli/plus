# Implementation Plan for Plus App

This document outlines the steps needed to implement the Plus App â€“ an Expo mobile application that combines gratitude journaling with social networking elements similar to Twitter and BeReal. It leverages Firebase/Firestore for the backend, Firebase Authentication for user management, GlueStack UI for the frontend, and Gravatar for user profiles.

---

## 1. Project Setup

- Initialize a new Expo project using `npx create-expo-app plus`.
- Set up a Git repository and branching strategy for feature development.
- Install necessary dependencies:
  - Expo and React Native
  - Firebase SDK (Firestore, Authentication, and Firebase Functions if needed)
  - GlueStack UI library
  - Gravatar integration library (or implement Gravatar URL generation manually using MD5 hashing)
- Configure ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.

---

## 2. Firebase & Firestore Integration

- **Firebase Project Setup**
  - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
  - Enable Firebase Authentication (email/password sign-up, potentially social login later).
  - Enable Cloud Firestore and draft initial security rules.

- **Database Schema**
  - Create collections for:
    - `users`: user_id, username, email, profilePicture (Gravatar URL), points, friends
    - `journals`: post_id, user_id, timestamp, content (array of bullet points), privacy settings
    - `friendships`: request_id, requester_id, receiver_id, status (pending, accepted, declined)

- **Security Rules**
  - Write Firestore rules to ensure that only authenticated users can read/write their own data.
  - Implement rules to control access so that only friends can view published journal entries.

---

## 3. User Authentication & Onboarding

- **Sign-Up/Login Flows**
  - Develop screens for user registration and login using GlueStack's `Form`, `Input`, and `Button` components.
  - Integrate Firebase Auth for user registration and sign-in.
  - Validate user inputs and provide feedback using GlueStack's `Toast` components.

- **Onboarding**
  - Prompt new users to create a unique username.
  - Offer an option to load contacts for friend suggestions.
  - Allow users to select or automatically generate a profile picture via Gravatar using the provided email.

---

## 4. Core Feature Implementation

### 4.1 Gratitude Journaling

- **Journal Composition Screen**
  - Design a journaling interface with a multi-part bullet-point entry system using GlueStack's `TextArea`.
  - Implement draft saving capabilities locally with visual feedback (toasts or modals).
  - Allow users to post entries, which are then written to the `journals` Firestore collection.
  
- **Timeline & Feed**
  - Develop a Home Screen that displays journals in a threaded format using GlueStack's `Card` components.
  - Ensure that only journals from friends (and potentially self) are shown in the feed.

### 4.2 Friend System & Social Feed

- **Friend Management**
  - Create screens for searching and adding new friends.
  - Implement friend request workflow, storing requests in the `friendships` collection.
  - Handle request statuses (pending, accepted, declined) and update user's friend lists accordingly.

- **Social Interaction**
  - Notify users in real-time (or via periodic refresh) when a friend posts a new journal entry.
  - Use GlueStack's components such as `Avatar` and `Card` to showcase friends' profiles and journal previews.

---

## 5. Points & Gamification System

- **Point Calculation**
  - Define a points algorithm that rewards users based on journaling consistency and content quality.
  - Trigger point recalculation after successful journal posting (use Firebase Functions if computation needs to be server-side).

- **Profile and Leaderboards**
  - Design a Profile screen using the responsive GlueStack grid system to display user details and cumulative points.
  - Optionally, create a leaderboards view to foster friendly competition among users.

---

## 6. Notifications

- **Journaling Reminders**
  - Integrate Expo Push Notifications to remind users at set times to record their gratitude.
  - Set up notification scheduling and ensure that notifications trigger the journaling flow.

- **Friend Activity Notifications**
  - Notify users when a friend posts a new journal entry or when a friend request is received.

---

## 7. Offline Support & Performance Optimization

- **Offline Capability**
  - Implement local storage for draft journaling using AsyncStorage or similar solutions.
  - Ensure that entries sync to Firestore when connectivity is restored.

- **Performance**
  - Optimize list rendering (e.g., use FlatList with optimized key extraction).
  - Monitor performance and use React Native debugging tools to identify bottlenecks.

---

## 8. Testing and Deployment

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for key components and functionalities using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
  - Conduct manual testing on both iOS and Android simulators/emulators, as well as physical devices.
  - Perform user testing sessions to gather feedback on the UI/UX.

- **Deployment**
  - Prepare for beta releases using Expo's over-the-air updates.
  - Finalize and deploy the app to respective app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) after thorough testing.

---

## 9. Roadmap & Milestones

- **Phase 1: Setup & Core Implementation**
  - Project setup, Firebase configuration, basic authentication, and journaling functionality.

- **Phase 2: Social Features & Friend System**
  - Implement friend management, social feed, and Gravatar profile integration.

- **Phase 3: Gamification & Notifications**
  - Add point system, profile achievements, and push notification workflows.

- **Phase 4: Optimization & Deployment**
  - Optimize performance, add offline support, comprehensive testing, and deploy.

## 10. Additional Considerations

- Maintain consistent UI/UX following GlueStack's design principles (theming, accessibility, responsive design).
- Regularly review and update Firestore security rules as new features are added.
- Plan for scalability in the backend to accommodate increased user activity and data volume.
- Document APIs and component interfaces to maintain clarity among team members.
